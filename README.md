# Unity Plug-In for Loading User Data CSV

During the use of the VR applications of DigiLab4U, user data is collected for evaluation.
One set of data includes the position and orientation of the VR headset in the scene.
This also allows the user's position in the room and his viewing direction to be traced back to a specific time period.

This plug-in makes it possible to load the entire pose data, which is available as a CSV, into the Unity Editor.
This data should then be visualized in the scene as a kind of heat map.

**To Do's:**
- [ ] Create a menu point and an Editor Plug-In for the Unity Engine
- [ ] Load CSV data and store it in an appropriate format for later processing
- [ ] Visualize Data Points
